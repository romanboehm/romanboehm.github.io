Roman BÃ¶hm is a software engineer living in WÃ¼rzburg, Germany. He is mostly interested in Java, the JVM, the Spring framework, RDBMs, and producing boring yet stable software.

After finishing his B. Eng. in Computer Science at THWS WÃ¼rzburg in 2019 with distinction, he went on to work for Flyeralarm GmbH WÃ¼rzburg where he sped up a distributed system guiding several thousand orders a day into print.

In 2022 he moved on to be a Senior Software Engineer at sprd.net AG Leipzig where he's carefully tuning services to make sure the company's collection of millions of images is being served and updated without a hiccup.

Roman's side projects include [JSON Wheel](https://github.com/romanboehm/jsonwheel), a tiny, hackable JSON deserializer for the JVM, and [wichtelnng](https://github.com/romanboehm/wichtelnng), a secret santa tech demo showing off recent Java and Spring Boot.
