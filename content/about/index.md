Roman Böhm is a software engineer living in Würzburg, Germany. He is mostly interested in Java, the JVM, the Spring framework, RDBMs, and producing boring yet stable software.

After finishing his B. Eng. in Computer Science at THWS Würzburg in 2019 with distinction, he went on to work for Flyeralarm GmbH Würzburg where he sped up a distributed system guiding several thousand orders a day into print.

In 2022, Roman moved on to be a Senior Software Engineer, as of 2023 Technical Lead, for sprd.net AG Leipzig. There, he's carefully tuning and crafting services to make sure the company's collection of millions of images is being served and updated without a hiccup.

Roman's side projects include

- [JSON Wheel](https://github.com/romanboehm/jsonwheel): a tiny, hackable JSON deserializer for the JVM
- [wichtelnng](https://wichtelnng.romanboehm.com), a secret santa tech demo showing off recent Java and Spring Boot
- [dupleasure](https://dupleasure.romanboehm.com), a web application to reorder PDF docs as if they'd been duplex scanned
- [ocrical](https://ocrical.romanboehm.com/): have an LLM run OCR on an image/PDF and generate an iCal file from the schedule-related data
- [pxmm](https://pxmm.romanboehm.com/), a tiny page to convert from pixels to mm and vice-versa, allowing for a custom DPI value.
