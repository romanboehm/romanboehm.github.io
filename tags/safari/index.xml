I was looking for some kind of bulk import functionality in Safari itself, but only found the option to add multiple tabs to the reading list. With my former list containing over 300 items, that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the way to go.
Solution Luckily, MacOS&amp;rsquo; Notes app offers a way to bypass the need to open hundreds of tabs, provided you have the reading list items available as a new line-separated list of links.</description></item></channel></rss>
