You can type two opening curly brackets followed by &amp;lt;text&amp;gt; followed by two closing curly brackets, and that will render &amp;lt;text&amp;gt; monospaced. But that does not work for applying formatting later one.
Solution There&amp;rsquo;s a nice, generic workaround for problems like these: Bookmarklets. They live as bookmarks in your browser, but you can see them as buttons being able to execute JavaScript on click.</description></item></channel></rss>
